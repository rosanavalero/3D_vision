# 3D Vision - 3D recovery of urban scenes
Project of the Module 4: '3D Vision' of the Master's degree in Computer Vision at Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB)

## Summary
This repository contains the source code and documentation for the Urban 3D Scene Recovery Project. Our project aims to explore and implement fundamental concepts and techniques for reconstructing real-world urban scenes from multiple images captured from various viewpoints. The techniques developed in this repository have broad applications across various domains, including image mosaics, augmented reality, depth computation, 3D reconstruction, localization, navigation, and new view synthesis.
